      <p>
        GIGI Films is a Brussels-based production company driven by real people
        and real stories. We create films and visual projects that are raw,
        honest, and deeply human. With a strong focus on diversity, street
        casting, and collaboration, we are committed to building an inclusive
        film cultureâ€”one that gives space to new voices and highlights
        underrepresented perspectives.
