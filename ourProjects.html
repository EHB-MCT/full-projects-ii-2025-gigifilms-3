						At <strong> GIGI Films </strong>, we work with real people — no
						acting experience, just raw presence and honest energy. On this
						page, you’ll find a selection of the films, video projects, and
						campaigns we’ve cast. Each project reflects our belief that great
						stories begin with real faces, real voices, and genuine connection.
						We look beyond the obvious — and find talent where others might not.
						Here, you can explore some of the work we’ve helped bring to life.
						Each project carries its own rhythm, shaped by the people in front
						of the camera. Whether it's a quiet moment or a loud one, what you
						see is always real — because that's what we stand for.

						Putain is a Belgian drama series that follows the life of Gigi, a
						teenager growing up in Brussels amidst layered family dynamics and
						social realities. Raw, bold, and unfiltered, the series explores
						what it means to come of age in a city full of contradictions.
						Blending humor, absurdity, and deep emotional insight, Putain paints
						a vivid picture of youth navigating identity, pressure, and
						belonging. The multilingual narrative — weaving Dutch, French,
						Arabic, and Lingala — adds authenticity and reflects the vibrant,
						fractured spirit of Brussels itself. More than a coming-of-age
						story, Putain is a sharp, intimate, and unapologetically honest
						portrait of urban adolescence.

						Skiff is a Belgian coming-of-age feature film directed by Cecilia
						Verheyden. The story centers on Malou, a 15-year-old girl who stands
						out in the world of competitive rowing, yet finds herself adrift
						when it comes to the complexities of home, identity, and belonging.
						Set against a quiet but emotionally charged backdrop, Skiff captures
						the inner tensions of adolescence with nuance and tenderness. As
						Malou navigates shifting relationships and unexpected emotions, the
						film explores how moments of confusion can become turning points of
						growth. With restrained visuals and a strong emotional undercurrent,
						Skiff offers an intimate, layered portrait of a girl on the edge of
						change — both in sport and in life.

						Ana + Yek (Me + You) follows twin sisters Sanaa and Zohra. What
						begins as Zohra’s exploration of their Moroccan heritage gradually
						reveals the shifting dynamics of their relationship, as Sanaa’s
						deepening love for Islam becomes more apparent. The film unfolds as
						a journey of mutual understanding — a cinematic dialogue fueled by
						their desire to connect. An intimate portrait of sisterly love and
						independence.
