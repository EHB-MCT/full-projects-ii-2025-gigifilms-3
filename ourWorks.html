    <p class="Info">
      At GIGI Films, we work with real people — no acting experience, just raw
      presence and honest energy. On this page, you’ll find a selection of the
      films, video projects, and campaigns we’ve cast. Each project reflects our
      belief that great stories begin with real faces, real voices, and genuine
      connection. We look beyond the obvious — and find talent where others
      might not. Here, you can explore some of the work we’ve helped bring to
      life. Each project carries its own rhythm, shaped by the people in front
      of the camera. Whether it's a quiet moment or a loud one, what you see is
      always real — because that's what we stand for.

        Putain is a Belgian drama series that follows the life of Gigi, a
        teenager growing up in Brussels amidst layered family dynamics and
        social realities. Raw, bold, and unfiltered, the series explores what it
        means to come of age in a city full of contradictions. Blending humor,
        absurdity, and deep emotional insight, Putain paints a vivid picture of
        youth navigating identity, pressure, and belonging. The multilingual
        narrative — weaving Dutch, French, Arabic, and Lingala — adds
        authenticity and reflects the vibrant, fractured spirit of Brussels
        itself. More than a coming-of-age story, Putain is a sharp, intimate,
        and unapologetically honest portrait of urban adolescence.

        <p>
          Skiff is a Belgian coming-of-age feature film directed by Cecilia
          Verheyden. The story centers on Malou, a 15-year-old girl who stands
          out in the world of competitive rowing, yet finds herself adrift when
          it comes to the complexities of home, identity, and belonging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set against a quiet but emotionally charged backdrop, Skiff captures
          the inner tensions of adolescence with nuance and tenderness. As Malou
          navigates shifting relationships and unexpected emotions, the film
          explores how moments of confusion can become turning points of growth.
          With restrained visuals and a strong emotional undercurrent, Skiff
          offers an intimate, layered portrait of a girl on the edge of change —
          both in sport and in life.

          Ana + Yek (Me + You) follows twin sisters Sanaa and Zohra. What begins
          as Zohra’s exploration of their Moroccan heritage gradually reveals
          the shifting dynamics of their relationship, as Sanaa’s deepening love
          for Islam becomes more apparent. The film unfolds as a journey of
          mutual understanding — a cinematic dialogue fueled by their desire to
          connect. An intimate portrait of sisterly love and independence.
